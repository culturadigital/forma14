Brief: Since the second half of the twentieth century a deep change is being

consummated in the urban planning ́s history due mainly to private transport

development. This change can be seen especially in the design of urban profile that

associated to a slight increase in urban population, a large increase in the urbanized

area. This mutation is characterized by an accentuation of land consumption and a

deep reorganization of spaces towards greater territorial specialization setting new

mono-functional centrality linked to leisure, commercial and tertiary spaces and

supported in the development of networks which facilitate the flows. From this

perspective, the issue of the metropolitan dimension of urban development from the

formal understanding of spatial organization poses a fundamental question:

metropolitan areas by definition have no end because of the developmental model on

which they are based?

In a first stage, the question of the metropolitan ́s definition in a territorial dimension

as a particular way to organize the land use involves in one hand, consideration of the

density and organization of urbanized space, and on the other hand the integration of

road network as a cohesive element being considering as optimal a model that tends

towards the sustainability of the whole.

Based upon a reflection on the need for a greater consideration of territorial variability

of the phenomena in constructing models, it is intended to use the proposed methods

and analytic tools within the framework of this experience to tackle this reflection from

a diachronic and quantitative approach of an Andalusian metropolitan area illustrative

of the degree of conversion of Spanish urban model from the 1990s and the first

decade of the XXI century, proposing an approach to the dynamics spaces classified

as mono-centric metropolitan (Sevilla), polycentric (Cadiz-Jerez de la Frontera) or

linear (Malaga-Costa del Sol). In this way it is intended make available to managers,

technicians and metropolitan citizens a global scale tool, allowing not only to place

thematically each metropolitan area in their context but also to provide a support

instrument to the decision making at the time of carrying out historical follow and a

simulation scenario for the development of interventions.

Key question: Is there a limit to the urban expansion of metropolitan areas?
