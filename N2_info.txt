Brief: The purpose of the model is through the concept of carrying capacity of El

Palmar in Vejer de la Frontera, found in the urban planning process: which of the

proposals capacity host user creates a better balance between the three principals

impacts by an intervention of urban planning: social, economic and environmental

impact.

The objective of this model is the approach of urban scale simulation. The process

model is divided into two scenarios: baseline to the input data, and execution of 80

ticks which equals the study performed 20 years after ordination. The first is when we

select the increase (PI, SI or TI), select whether or not seasonal pattern, and spatial

distribution of agents occurs. Once distributed agents begin ticks every four ticks the

counter is reset. This means that the occupancy level discussed in previous sections,

corresponding to four ticks, so the functions of ticks occur 80 times, but every four

ticks are generated different situations because of the 4 quarters of a year. The status

of each agent begins execution and occurs in the appended order functions. Once

done the whole process, in each graph of the environmental, social and landscape

impacts and a joint graph where we see the consequences of proposed urban model.

Key question: What is the optimal hosting capacity of El Palmar?
