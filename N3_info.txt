Brief: According to currently available archeological data, the origin of human

populations (of hundreds or thousands of individuals) takes plane in the recent

Prehistory, more specifically, in the Bronze Age period. These groups of individuals

are called chiefdoms in social anthropology: chiefdoms societies are known to own a

number of features as certain internal variation, division of labor, foodstuff storage,

craftsmen and other segments of society exempt of physical effort (like agriculture or

livestock), social hierarchy, etc.

In particular, in the Iberian Peninsula is at the beginning of Copper Age (around year

3000 BC) when starts the emergence of big populations as well as extensive and

sound cooperation networks interlinking those. At this point, archeological sites show:

large fortified settlements (with walls, towers with loopholes and other poliorcetics

related elements); developed weaponry (knifes, arrowheads, spears, etc.); material

culture with biased (non-uniform) spatial distributions at both, intra and inter-societal

levels, where some objects denote certain social level and therefore can only be found

in certain segments of society; asymmetric and hierarchical settlements organization

around possibly assembled territories (by means of religion and politics); first

collective burials (megalith) and princely graves; etc.

Key question: Under which conditions and historical factors it is possible the

emergence of complex and large agriculture and livestock-based societies where

collectivity prevails over individuality (around IV-III millenniums BC)?
