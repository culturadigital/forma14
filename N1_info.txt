Brief: Traditionally, the information that has been offered as support for urban designers was organized like a sum of active legislation, in the form of ordinances, contexts defined by contour lines and a few social statistics, in their best option. This situation has generated a set of unilateral decisions which in many cases led to processes of social disease.

To reach the potential on the practical field, it is essential to understand the position of the new multi-agent design tools, those that make up the full capacity of a programming language within a social study.

The control over these could help for a radical expansion around the intermediate data in the moments that are mixed with the decision making. Just in this moment when a crossed information is necessary, by its implications, also incorporating methodologies with a sensitive feedback, open to its evolution in time and, above all, transparent. The design process starts, therefore, in the composition of the working machine itself.

In this experiment our objective will be to bring on abstract cities by their essential uses, the statistical behavior of inhabitants with different affinities for these specific areas. The behavior of the whole, and its sustainability over time, and the consequences generated by each family will provide us a complex data on the spatial study of urban environments.
